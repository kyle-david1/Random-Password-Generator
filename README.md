Title: Random Password Generator
This project uses javascript components to generate a random password for the user. 
The user is asked a series of prompts for different criteria to be included in the randomly generated password. 
After the user answers the prompts satisfactorily, javascript will return a password given the parameters.

This application can be used directly in the browser window. The javascript and CSS files are linked to the HTML, 
which the user will select to open in default browser. Upon clicking "Generate Password," prompts will display 
and the user will enter information. 

The for loop through the array gave me trouble. I was not able to accomplish getting the for-loop to count over the array 
and actually generate the password.
